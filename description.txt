Control Corruption does exactly what it states. How it achieves this is rather... weird. It just slaps a bunch of clay everywhere that corruption spawns.
Thanks to GabeHasWon for worldgen stuff
Hardmode Corruption/Crimson/Hallowed will be surrounded with a layer of clay upon generation
Crimson will also be surrounded by a layer of clay upon worldgen
Hardmode ores will auto generate upon entering hardmode. By default 21 altars worth of ore will spawn. Can be changed in config.
Hardmode ores auto generating can also be turned off in config

This mod adds 1 item, "The Container". It is crafted with 10 clay blocks, and upon usage, it will surround all corruption / crimson / hallow with a layer of clay.

Refer to forum post (Mod home page) for complete explanation of all config options
